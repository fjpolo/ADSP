Python real time audio example: This
example takes the microphone input and
samples it, without removing the zeros, and
plays it back the the speaker in real time.
It constructs a unit pulse train, with a 1 at
every N'th sample, using the modulus
function „%“,
s=(np.arange(0,CHUNK)%N)==0
Start it with:
python pyrecplay_samplingblock.py
